OCR Module for KYC/AML Verification
Overview
This OCR module extracts text from scanned images and PDFs to automate the KYC (Know Your Customer) and AML (Anti-Money Laundering) verification process. It uses Tesseract OCR for text recognition and OpenCV for image preprocessing to enhance accuracy.

Features
âœ” Extracts text from images (JPG, PNG, etc.)
 âœ” Converts PDFs into images and extracts text from each page
 âœ” Uses grayscale conversion and optional thresholding for better OCR accuracy
 âœ” Can be integrated into KYC/AML workflows for automated compliance

Installation
1. Install Dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

2. Install Tesseract OCR
Download and install Tesseract OCR:
 ðŸ”— Tesseract OCR for Windows
 ðŸ”— Linux/macOS: Install via package manager (sudo apt install tesseract-ocr or brew install tesseract)

Usage
Extract Text from an Image
from ocr_module import extract_text_from_image

text = extract_text_from_image("data/sample_id.jpg")
print(text)

Extract Text from a PDF
from ocr_module import extract_text_from_pdf

text = extract_text_from_pdf("data/sample_document.pdf")
print(text)

Future Improvements
Enhance Preprocessing: Adaptive thresholding and noise removal
Improve Text Accuracy: Fine-tune Tesseract OCR for better results
Add NLP Processing: Extract structured details like Name, DOB, and Address
Deploy as API: Convert the module into a microservice for real-time OCR processing
